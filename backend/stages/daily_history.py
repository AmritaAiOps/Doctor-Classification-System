"""Persists each day's Final output values so MTD (month-to-date) and Daily
Average can be computed for the current month.

This app processes one day at a time and has no other memory of past days,
so true MTD (a running sum from the 1st of the month) requires remembering
every day already processed this month. That's what this store is for --
distinct from config/category_map.json and config/learned_overrides.json,
which are about category mapping, not daily figures.

Note: MTD/Daily Average will only reflect days actually processed through
this app. A month that started before this tool was in use will show a
partial MTD (missing the days before tracking began), not the true
month-to-date total -- there's no way to backfill days we never received.
