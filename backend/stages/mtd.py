"""Daily Average / MTD (Proj) columns for the current reporting month.

Two distinct things, per row:
  - True MTD = actual cumulative sum, 1st of month through today (not
    written anywhere on its own in the Final output template -- only its
    derivatives are).
  - Daily Average = true MTD actual / day-of-month-today.
  - MTD (Proj) = Daily Average * days_in_month -- a full-month forecast at
    today's pace, NOT the true MTD-so-far sum.

Not every row is a additive daily flow. Applying sum-then-average blindly to
a snapshot metric (bed occupancy, a percentage) or a fixed constant (Bed
Strength) produces a meaningless number, so each row is classified first.
