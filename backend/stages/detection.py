"""Stage 0.5: auto-detects which of the 9 required reports a given sheet is,
so staff can drop one combined workbook, 9 separate files, or any mix.

Detection order (highest confidence first), per the spec:
  1. Sheet name keyword match -- if exactly one report type's keywords appear
     in the (normalized) sheet name, that's a high-confidence match.
  2. Column-signature fallback -- if the sheet name is ambiguous or matches
     nothing, check the detected header row's columns against a known
     required/excluded keyword set per report type.
  3. Otherwise: undetected. Never silently guess -- surfaced to the frontend
     for manual assignment instead.

A single workbook can carry more than one sheet that matches the same report
type at equal confidence -- e.g. a raw export sheet alongside a staff-curated
copy with Domestic/International and Cash/Credit already tagged per row. When
that happens, backend.main breaks the tie using is_curated_billing_sheet()
below rather than picking whichever sheet happened to come first.
